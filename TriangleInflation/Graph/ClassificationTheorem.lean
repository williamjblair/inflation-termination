# The classification theorem (A7)

Theorem `thm:classification`: for a pair-source scenario with binary observations, some finite order of the Navascués–Wolfe test (equivalently of the ancestral-independence test, equivalently of the recursively expressible test) equals the compatible set iff every connected component is a double-star (`classification_NW_lib`, `classification_AI`, `classification_exp`), with the nontermination half `nontermination_of_not_doubleStar` assembled from the cycle and five-path witnesses, transport, exhaustion, and local flips. Everything here is proved.

/-- AUDIT-NOTES A7, the nontermination half. A pair graph with a component that is not a
double star carries, at every order, a full-support target that passes the recursively
expressible test and is incompatible. Full support comes from independent local flips at
every copied observation, which preserve symmetry and all AI products. -/
